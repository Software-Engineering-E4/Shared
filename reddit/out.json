        "selftext": "\n\n It\u2019s something like this: one day, you\u2019re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE\u2019S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.\n\nWait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!\n\nSo you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they\u2019re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - \u201cGET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU\u201d - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.\n\nAlso, for some reason, there\u2019s someone in the crowd who\u2019s yelling \u201cthat\u2019s not really a mountain lion, it\u2019s a puma\u201d and another person yelling \u201cI read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they\u2019re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn\u2019t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?\n\nFinally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming \u201cGODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,\u201d and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he\u2019s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.\n\nEventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying \u201ccan I get some help, I\u2019ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,\u201d and all you can say is \u201cI\u2019M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN\u2019T NOTICED I\u2019M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.\u201d\n\nThen, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.\n\nMaybe. You\u2019re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.\n\nAnd all your friends come running up to you and say \u201cthat was amazing! You\u2019re so brave, we\u2019re so proud of you! You didn\u2019t die! That must be a huge relief!\u201d\nMeanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you\u2019re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says \u201cboy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!\u201d And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is \u201cfuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.\u201d\n\n\n(these aren't my words but something I have read often the last few years and it handy for others to pass on if they can't find the words to answer the question themselves)",

I called him this morning, we chatted he has some concerns about maintaining the house, his rental houses and not everything fall on my mom while he\u2019s going through treatment. He\u2019s scared. I told him we will figure all that out and not to worry.\n\nWhat I really want to do is know how to best support him and my mom.

I don\u2019t want him to feel like he needs to write a will because I\u2019m calling him so much but I really want to be there to hear his concerns and i don\u2019t think he will reach out himself.

        "title": "Two months after my dad\u2019s battle with Melanoma",
        "selftext": "The timeline:\n\nTwo and a half years ago: My father (78 years old when he passed) had blood in his urine. He was diagnosed with bladder cancer, which lead to two stays in the hospital because he was a bit cavalier in his treatment (BST) and lived alone. During this time he also had a stage 1 melanoma removed. Because of the chaos around his bladder cancer (and trying to avoid covid), the melanoma was thought to be dealt with.\n\nDecember 18, 2021: I was making my Christmas visit (I\u2019m his only child) and we went out to dinner. I had noticed over the last year that walking up any sort of incline was increasingly difficult. During the drive home I noticed a lot more hesitancy in his driving. It was nighttime post-dinner. He revealed to me that he had difficulty seeing the stoplights and while stopped at an intersection he said he saw five stoplights where there were only four. I told him he shouldn\u2019t drive at night anymore, he agreed.\n\nDecember 19: I wake before him and fix my breakfast. I notice he is taking longer than usual to emerge from his bedroom. When he finally comes out he looks visibly shaken. He reveals that he just experienced something like a seizure. He was unable to move the left side of his body and his left arm was jerking uncontrollably. He was better once it stopped. Looking back I should have taken him to the hospital immediately, but it was just as the Omicron surge was hitting and going to an emergency room was more ill advised than normal. Also my dad really didn\u2019t want to go back to a hospital. I told him he really needed to get this checked out. Another complication was it was Christmastime, and his primary care doctor retired in October. He didn\u2019t really have relationship with his new doc yet.\n\nDecember 20: He tells me he will get a head MRI on January 6. Over the next two weeks he reports no additional seizures. He also doesn\u2019t want me telling anyone in his life about this.\n\nJanuary 6, 2022: MRI. He texts me the MRI notes from the hospital. They are looking for a possible stroke.\n\nJanuary 7: Hospital instructs him to immediately drive to the hospital to get checked in and have a body MRI. \u201cThis might be a big bite\u201d he texts me.\n\nJanuary 8: Doctors reveal to him that he has stage 4 Melanoma, which has spread to his lungs, liver, and brain. He also reveals he has a lump on his chest. Because this day is his 78th birthday the doctors do not quite impress on him the gravity of his situation. He thinks it\u2019s treatable and agrees to immediate radiation and immunotherapy.\n\nJanuary 10: He begins ten days of radiation therapy. He will lose his hair. He keeps telling me \u201cI think I\u2019m going to beat this.\u201d\n\nJanuary 12: I sit him down to talk about what he wants done if he passes, he\u2019s not entirely ready to engage in this conversation. At this point he is still able to walk short distances and feed himself. He still wants to live in his home, which he purchased just the May before, alone. The doctors have told him no more driving, which he agrees to.\n\nJanuary 14: He gets a ride to the hospital for treatment and in the process loses his wallet. He asks me numerous times if I have taken it.\n\nJanuary 16: I make the two hour drive to look for his wallet in his house and fail to find it. This was not a fun trip. We order a replacement credit and bank card. It\u2019s a bad time to lose his insurance card.\n\nJanuary 18: Meet with the immunotherapy doctor. She lays out the three month immunotherapy schedule and wants my father checked in to the hospital, and then have him moved into assisted living. She says she will set this up. I say \u201cdo I need to do anything?\u201d She says no, it will be taken care of. Great I think, because splitting time from my home and at my dad\u2019s is getting difficult.\n\nJanuary 19: Go to hospital for radiation with bags packed to be checked in. On arrival it turns out\u2026 nothing has been prepared for him to stay in the hospital and there is no space in the hospital for him. Immunotherapy doctor won\u2019t return multiple calls (turns out it will be 15 days before she will finally return a call). This day has me in a panic. Assisted living homes are either full or infected with Covid. Along with melanoma my father also has Pulmonary Fibrosis. While he is fully vaccinated avoiding Covid is critical for him. After many calls I get an appointment with an in-home care service.\n\nJanuary 20: In-home care has initial visit. They are responsibly run and recommend 24 hour care given his situation. Dad talks them down to 8 hours of care a day. He still likes his independence. They can start care on January 25. He just has to last until then I think.\n\nJanuary 24: He is supposed to get a ride to his last radiation therapy, but he never makes it. He is found on the floor of his house and paramedics are called. He thinks he tried to sit on the toilet and missed. I later see that he probably fell in the kitchen. He is admitted to the emergency room. Given the Covid situation I am not able to enter the ER. He ends up spending three days in the hospital. I observe him try to walk for the last time while being tested by the physical therapist. He can walk about four steps. This makes his blood pressure go down. He has had low blood pressure for years now. The lack of blood pressure is why he fell.\n\nJanuary 27: Dad is released from the hospital but they won\u2019t let me drive him home. He comes home in an ambulance strapped to a stretcher. In-home care has been increased to 24 hour care. Immunotherapy is still scheduled somehow (and the doctor still hasn\u2019t returned a call) . I start asking what doctors I can speak to (and it\u2019s been a wild assortment of doctors now, most I speak to only once) if he should be in hospice care. None give me a definitive answer.\n\nJanuary 31: A hospital bed is rented for his home, as he has fallen out of his bed a couple times now. I make the decision to have him evaluated for hospice care and the nurse admits him. This makes things better, as now nurses will start visiting on almost a daily basis. Dad still thinks he is going to recover. I can\u2019t bear to tell him what is happening.\n\nFebruary 2: I finally hear back from the immunotherapy doctor. I yell at them.\n\nFebruary 3: Dad has had significant hearing loss since his 20\u2019s and has worn a hearing aid. The swelling in his head is so bad now that he can\u2019t insert his hearing aid anymore, rendering him essentially deaf. I can only communicate with him now by typing things out on the notes app on my iPhone. He wants to hire a doctor so he can walk again. Using the notes app I tell him all we can do is make him comfortable. I have a long cry.\n\nFebruary  4: A hospice social worker tells me to go home, because I am on the verge of cracking. Dad is now getting morphine injections. Hospice is a godsend. I spend the weekend at home away from all of this.\n\nFebruary 7: Come back. Dad is moaning from the pain. Morphine injections are eventually increased to every 90 minutes, with Ativan given regularly now as well. He is not eating or talking. I decide to stay until the end.  Getting preloaded morphine syringes is difficult. Twice we had the hospice\u2019s pharmacy have them delivered via taxi after hours. Opiate laws are more stringent now.\n\nFebruary 9: An old friend of his that I haven\u2019t seen since my childhood comes by to say goodbye.\n\nFebruary 11: Dad passes away peacefully.\n\nCODA\n\nApril 2: I find the wallet that he lost on the floor of his garage.",

I feel like I haven\u2019t been able to breathe since I found out. \n\nThe path report says 1.2MM at least, mitosis rate of 2, non-ulcerated. I talked to my derm again today &amp; mentioned how confused I was that it was melanoma since it\u2019s never changed. She talked to the pathologist again this morning who looked at the slide again and the path told her that the mole itself was actually healthy and the melanoma arose next to it. The pathology report is clear that the specimen they received is 1MM depth and the depth of the melanoma extends to the wide and lateral margins. I asked for clarification because they just shaved the mole and not any of the surrounding skin and she said that the path said that a new \u201cmole\u201d aka melanoma grew up next to the original mole and that it was \u201cseparated by a dimple\u201d. Mind you, I\u2019ve never seen any changes in it. My derm says it\u2019s fine that none of that was in the pathology report, including the type of melanoma.

She wants to go and see her dad and leave us to grieve and it\u2019s day 4 in the hospital and we can\u2019t get a straight answer on how much longer this is going to continue. She\u2019s only 62. She was so healthy. This cancer has already taken so much from us and now she can\u2019t even pass with dignity and we have to wait for nature to take its course while I sob every time she chokes or sputters if the medicine doesn\u2019t hit on time or it\u2019s time for one of the timed whatever\u2019s. She\u2019s fought a good fight. And while I honestly never thought she wouldn\u2019t beat it\u2026 we are all ready. She deserves peace. So my baby brother and I will continue to watch her and be here for her while our dad takes one night to go home and collect himself before he rejoins us in our vigil.\n\nEDIT: My amazing mother passed away at 12:25 PM 4/11. Thank you everyone. My eyes are open not only to the impact of cancer but how we handle palliative care and what we need to change.",

        "selftext": "My wife had a bout with melanoma 4 years ago.  She had surgery, but no chemo.  She has had no recurrences of cancer, but did have a strange yearlong period where she lost weight \"For no reason\" but has since gained weight back.\n\nIn the first 18 months after her surgery she had anxiety about cancer.  This was real and I know she was dealing with issues from it.  \n\nAt the beginning of COVID her cancer anxiety faded, but she was left with a \"Cancer Fog.\"  This is a point of great contention / argument between us, but she is NOT the same as she used to be.  She is mildly slow on the uptake, slow to react to danger or stress,  mostly incapable of thinking or acting quickly.  She is not \"ditzy.\"   There is nothing air-headed here.  It's like we have a conversation and she continually thinks other people saying the most basic things, like she misses every nuance.  \n\nSample quote.  My teenager says, \"French Fries are really very 'Murican.\"  And she responds, \"French Fries are not really from France, they're from Belgium.\"  And we're left scratching our heads, like, did you hear what we said?  The majority of conversations every day end in arguments, often because she tries to correct others or \"teach\" them about topics mostly unrelated to anything that was said.  This isn't air-headed, it's much more obtuse, but it happens every single day.\n\nNaturally when this first happened, she started getting in trouble at work and was eventually fired in Summer 2020.  Since then, she's been unable to find anyone who will hire her.  The few times I've heard her do phone interviews, she doesn't seem to understand the questions and bombed.  Those are only the interviews I've heard.  All I can say is that it appears she misinterprets most discussions and seems to \"dumb them down\" but I swear that none of this ever happened before cancer.\n\nIs there such a thing as non-Chemo Cancer Fog?  Is there a treatment for this?",

Well, I\u2019m new here and I\u2019m grateful to find a community in this where I hopefully won\u2019t feel so alone. \n\nA little over a month ago on March 7th I had an elective bilateral salpingectomy for the only reason of sterilization. However, I woke up to the news that they had also performed a surprise appendectomy. I had endometriosis in an ovary, lining of my bladder and my uterus\u2026and also what they thought was in my appendix. I had a severe delayed allergic reaction to the medical adhesive, and multiple times my sutures rejected through my skin. I was already emotionally done with this and ready to get back to normal life. \n\nAfter pathology came back 4 days after surgery, it turns out that it wasn\u2019t endo. It was a 2.9cm G1, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor on my 5cm appendix. As far as I was aware, the margins were negative, it was removed and that was that. They referred me to a colorectal surgeon to go over pathology further. \n\nWelp, that appointment was on April 6th and it sure did go sideways quick. I was told that the cancer was also on the connective tissue and that I needed a colonoscopy, a scan to stage my cancer and regardless of the results an very high suggested right hemicolectomy. \n\nMy scan is scheduled for the 18th and needless to say I\u2019m having a rollercoaster of emotions. I am a otherwise healthy 28 year old woman, happily divorced for two years and just opened my small business. I feel like my world is just being crushed before I have barely lived in it.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI have posted previously to recruit participants for our study about the feeling of unfairness and its influence on mental health in cancer patients. However, we are still in need of more participants so we would highly appreciate it if you could consider taking part.\n\n\nExperiences of injustice can arise at different stages throughout the cancer disease - when the patient is confronted with the feeling of \"why me?\" after the initial cancer diagnosis (e.g. they have never engaged in any bad lifestyle choice that could have led to cancer), the case of cancer recurrence or in relation to experiences in the hospital (e.g. surgical complications, infections).\nPeople deal differently with those feelings of unfairness and for some individuals this could contribute to symptoms of depression which have been associated with problematic recovery and treatment outcomes in cancer patients. Our study tries to understand IF there is a connection between experiences of injustice and mental health, WHAT this tells psychotherapists in the treatment of depression in psycho-oncology and HOW experiences of injustice could be prevented in the first place.\n\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this piece of research, are over the age of 18 and have or have had cancer, we would highly appreciate it if you could fill out this survey (10-15 minutes) -\n\nhttps://ucdpsychology.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3dZjc1b70vsHAmG\n\n\nThank you so much in advance and I wish you all the best.\nLuisa",

My husband has stage 4 metastatic melanoma and he started out with tumors in his lungs, liver, brain, femur, and on his tail bone. He did immunotherapy like yervo and something else and it worked really well and pretty much shrunk everything down. \n\nHowever, there where some breakthrough tumors and he developed one on his spine and it cause some sciatica nerve pain on his right side. However, he did radiation and that shrunk it down a bit and it's not growing or doing anything. However, ever since then he has had painful, awful neuropathy in his feet and the oncologist doesn't really seem to have an answer on how to get rid of it, what's the cause, what are some pain management he can use for it. He referred us to a pallative care guy and he prescribed gabapentin but it didn't do anything. \n\nHe referred us to a neurologist who was useless. We had to wait three months to be seen and then when we finally made it to the appointment, she had no idea why we were there and had to leave the appointment in the middle of it to pull up his file and CT scans to take a look at his medical records. Like she was really unprepared. She did some EMG test where they shocked his legs with electric impulses and then she told him that the neuropathy was from the tumor on his spine and the immunotherapy drugs (well no shit).  She prescribed him Lyrica now but all that does is make him dizzy. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on what we could try? My husband's quality of life is really suffering. He said if he could get the tingling, pins and needles out of his feet the cancer would almost be manageable. I feel like the doctors are just like \"Yeah, that sucks.\"",

She went through a hysterectomy to remove her large tumor in her uterus before they had found that it spread to her lungs. She\u2019s undergone \u201cthe red devil\u201d treatment (something with doxorubicin I think), which ultimately wasn\u2019t working well enough and she was pulled from the trial. She started a targeted chemo pill and immunotherapy in January, but she will not be continuing with that any more. Her tumors have continued to grow under that treatment and she just feels awful. Exhausted. Like she can\u2019t do anything. It was worse than the other treatment, which she wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 her body just could not tolerate it.\nWe\u2019re taking a trip to Europe, just her and I, in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s always been her dream, so my family and I came together last year and got her this trip. She\u2019s SO excited, as am I, and I\u2019m so happy that this has been giving her something to look forward to. She\u2019s not doing any treatment until after the trip, and is looking at another treatment with 2 chemo pills. The other option is traditional chemo. I will always want what\u2019s best for her, but I\u2019m so scared that she\u2019s going to start letting go after this trip. My mom and I are extremely close, and this whole process has been heartbreaking. I know there\u2019s nothing I can do, and I just want to support her, and I know this cancer will likely be what she succumbs to, but god. It\u2019s just so hard. I can\u2019t imagine her not in my life. \nThis isn\u2019t so much a question or anything, but more me venting. This fucking sucks.

Getting more surgeries, alone, was hard. Now I don\u2019t even know how to socialize that well without making everything awkward. It all feels forced and painful, and I don\u2019t even like to tell anyone my medical history because they get that \u2018aw you had cancer?\u2019 face, and their voice goes like ten octaves higher and it gets completely weird and I start wondering how to make them more comfortable so I don\u2019t feel so bad. Even though I\u2019m the one that went through it. \n\nI\u2019m angry I lost a lot of time hating myself and idealizing the possibility of not surviving because I just felt so lonely for so long.

I feel like at any point I\u2019ll just go back to that hospital room with the smell of disinfectant hitting me while three doors down, and those sheets that made me sweat, with the stupid, ugly marble vinyl floors and that one awkward armchair pushed into the far corner. \n\nI\u2019ve avoided follow up appointments for the past three years because of COVID and overall not wanting to go back to the hospital, but I have a follow up appointment scheduled in a few weeks and all I want to do is scream and cry because I hate the thought of going back there for this. I didn\u2019t realize just how much it was making me feel this way until I broke down on my drive home from class. I\u2019ve been crying on and off since. \n\nI just hate cancer for doing this to me, I hate negligent doctors for making my experience so much worse, and I hate the fact I have to worry about this at the ripe, old age of 25 when everyone else, it seems, is getting to live a normal life.

He received a stoma and has a colostomy bag since. At the time of diagnosis it had already spread to his liver, lungs, and lymph nodes. He completed 6 months of intensive chemo, it was rough but he tolerated it fairly well. There was significant shrinkage of all tumors and no spread during treatment. He began chemo pills and a palliative infusion that was just once every three weeks for maintenance and the cancer grew slowly. The infusion caused stomach bleeding that filled his colostomy bag with blood so then he just took pills. In November of 2021 the cancer continued to progress and he had targeted radiation on the lung lymph nodes and Y90 radioembolisation to his liver around Christmas. This caused his lips and mouth to swell severely, I believe he may have been allergic to some degree. Neither of these things worked, perhaps they caused the cancer to spread faster. In February he was accepted to complete in a research trial for an immunotherapy drug, it took a month to qualify which meant lots of tests and then had two rounds before his scan revealed significant growth in all areas as well as spread to the urinary tract and heart. Today, he moved to hospice care. He is still walking (a struggle), eating (very little), and is himself (unless taking anxiety meds which cause some confusion). I am very much heartbroken and I pray every day that they can stop this monster of a disease from eating people alive. \n\nI remember searching for other people's stories at the beginning of and throughout my dad's cancer journey because it helped me find comfort in knowing others experiences, so I wanted to share his story because I don't have anything to search for anymore.

I\u2019m just so mindfucked by all of this and how one month she can be fine and then the next month she\u2019s a shell of herself. \n\nI think that\u2019s all for now, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have more questions as we go along.

        "selftext": "I just have a question as I've learnt by now it's better to hear it from professionals or people's experiences rather than scare myself with Dr. Google. \n\nBasically my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer 15 years ago now. At the time they removed his prostate with surgery but there was still cancer so they did radiation. A while later they began hormone treatment where he's been having hormone injections for many years now depending on his PSA levels. Little things have come up during this time but overall they've never been able to pinpoint where the cancer is as it wouldn't show up on scans until a few weeks ago when his PSA levels jumped a significant amount. \n\nHis latest scans have shown there is cancer on a few places of his spine, he will do radiation and he said that should suppress it for maybe 6 months but that's all he will say atm. He's always pretty optimistic for our families benefit and I don't like to bombard him with questions because he's always vague so I was wondering if anyone has any personal experience with this as I'm terrified his time is running out. I would like to know if people can survive this and if this is going to cause him much pain as he never tells us when he's hurting and works long hours and is always doing things around the house and outside for our family.\n\n I am very grateful he has lived 10 years longer than he was told he would and feel selfish being so distraught when other people have it so much worse but my mum got breast cancer in 2020 and is also on hormone treatment after chemo and radiation and it just feels like they aren't catching a break. I like to be realistic and would like to gain a better understanding of what will be happening next for him so I can deal with my emotions quickly personally and be there for them. \n\nThank you in advance if you are able to share some insight and sorry I don't have more information to be clearer.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMy 60 year old mom got diagnosed with gallbladder cancer. It is most likely stage 3. It has spread to the base of her liver, a lymph node and a nearby blood vessel. We had been to the ER to get her checked out for bloating issues. There they discovered a 20 cm mass on her ovary and a 5 cm mass in the gallbladder fossa. She had the ovarian tumor removed a few days back. The doctors have said that the gallbladder tumor is inoperable right now. The doctors are waiting for her biopsy to come back before letting us know the course of action. But it is likely going to be chemo and/or radiation to see if the tumor shrinks. If it does, then they might do the tumor resection followed by another round of chemo.\n\nFrom my online reading, it doesn't seem like there is much hope. The doctors have said she might have 2-3 years to live. The studies I could find only help prolong her life by a few months. I am just wondering if anyone here has any experience with this and any recommendations on what we can do. We are willing to travel for treatment as long as the cost is not outrageous.

        "selftext": "Hi everybody. My 70 year old dad was diagnosed with SCC of his right tonsil in February 2021. (Symptoms since November 2020) There is no mention in his records of HPV and he was an extremely heavy drinker and smoker, hasn't smoked since symptoms started and very very rarely has a beer now.\n\nWhile waiting for scans and treatment to start he struggled to swallow anything and lost massive amounts of weight, he was just above 6 stone at his worst and after I forced the issue and rang an ambulance they put in a NG tube for food, water and some medication. \n\nHe moved in with me and started what should have been 33 doses of radiation. It hit him so hard, a lot of this was because he was so weak from weight loss and he had multiple long stays in hospital so the radiation took months to complete. \n\nFast forward and they booked a PET scan but they booked it under the assumption his treatment would be long completed but in actual fact was only 2 weeks post completion. They said it was inconclusive. Eventually a CT scan in January showed something in his saliva gland and a biopsy confirmed SCC, this is now very visible just looking at him. \n\nThey initially offered surgery or chemo, he chose surgery then the day before they said they couldn't operate and offered intensive 5 day inpatient chemo or less intensive once a week for an undetermined amount of weeks, he chose intensive....today he went in for bloods before starting and they changed their mind again! \n\nHe is gutted but very quiet about it and does not advocate for himself. He is to start Erbitux (Cetuximab) on 12th April and I have no idea what to expect, we have an extra problem as we are English living in Spain, he was on holiday here with me (I live here) when he was diagnosed. He is getting special dispensation to stay here for treatment even without having residency which I am beyond grateful for. But every appointment is through a translator and I know I am not getting all the info I should to be able to advocate for him. \n\nI have some experience with cancer/oncology as I was a clinical coder in UK so I know if we were in England I would know what to ask and who to speak to as he would be treated in the hospital I worked at but here I feel massively out of my depth. (I offered him the choice to go home for treatment at multiple times throughout this and he always refuses he is adamant he wants to stay in Spain). The hospital is over an hour away from us and our car is off the road so he also has to rely on ambulance transfers which he hates but \nI can't do anything about that.\n\nWhat can he expect and what can I expect as his carer? I haven't been told about any sort of cancer care team for him and even if I did it would have to be through his translator. He is registered with a GP but hasn't actually met them more than a couple of times and they don't exactly provide a great support network. \n\nHis oncologist today just said he might get some skin problems and if he gets a fever to take him to emergency.\n\nI wasn't prepared for the radiotherapy side effects but after that experience I know I'm not being fully informed here and would like any and all advice or recommendations people might have. I don't even know how long each infusion is they just said it depends!! \n\nThank you for any advice.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I'm not really sure how to start so here I go.\n\nMom was diagnosed in Sept 2021 with rectal cancer, initially thought to be stage 1, possibly 2. She had a tumor the size of a smooshed golfball and had a bowel resection done. \n\nWe initially thought no ileostomy, chemo or radiation. After surgery she woke up with an ileostomy, was told she is stage 3 with cancer in a few lymphnodes. After a few setbacks she started chemo 5 FU in Feb, she has had 4 of a predicted 8 doses. \n\nHonestly she had really thrived with the chemo, felt good, got talkative and wanted to clean house. \n\nThen this past Wednesday she lost it. She lost hours of time, during which she made food and stashed it all over. Was really confused and thought it was strange she lost the time. Thursday she was mostly ok, but I called oncology and said we were worried it may be chemo brain, the dr said it didn't really sound it but take her to the ER for.eval. She refused that multiple times. I got an appt with her gp on Friday, and when I got there Friday she was really out of control, crying and upset. \n\nThe GP wanted her to get a CT in case if a TIA but she refused because she didnt want to go to a hospital. She was screaming and kicking in my car, and stuck repeating the same thing. It was a horrible day and a bad night. She slapped me and my brother, yanked my sis's hair, she never does this.\n\nSaturday she was normal! She was happy and herself, and even wanted to go out to lunch and watched movies. We thought maybe she was ok. \n\nSunday she was manic, just couldn't sit still, talked constantly, argued a lot. She has barely slept for days, and Monday am my sister said Mom was good at 5:30, acting like herself. An hour later I was racing to get there because she had wet the bed and was raving. I called her dr and she talked to the nurse who said call 911, and I did. \n\nNow Mom is in the hospital. CT and MRI do not show any signs of stroke or tumors, we are waiting to get results of urine tests and she is fighting a bladder scan. Her BP is crazy high, it's always high but it is really high, 230/70s, but has come down to 160/79.\n\nThe oncologist says this shouldn't be chemo related. The hospital says it very well could be. A couple of friends that had parents go through chemo said their family members suddenly did this, too.\n\nI am exhausted..My brother &amp; sister both are, too. So is Mom. I feel guilty calling 911 but she needed help we couldn't give at home. I don't know what we should do, Mom may be discharged tomorrow and is due for chemo friday. The dr wanted to delay a week last time but Mom wanted to push on.\n\nShe called me a dozen times in the night, called bro &amp; sis that many, I visited her today and she knows something is wrong with her but not what. We try to explain but she doesn't seem to process it right. She's scared, lonely and incredibly angry. I have her number muted so I can sleep but will hear if the hospital calls me. \n\nI don't know what else to do\n\nfuck\n\nthank you for listening\n\nupdate: Thank you so much for all the kind words and ideas. I'm too tired right now to reply to everyone individually.\n\nMom is still in the hospital, still raving. The hospital drs and her gp are strongly leaning to this being chemo induced. Friday's chemo is cancelled as of now because there is no way we can bring her. She is fighting getting meds, pills or access to iv. I don't know what will happen :(\n\nUpdate #2:  Mom has been in the hospital a week, she seemed ok yesterday and is off the wall today. Still no idea of the cause of all this. I visited yesterday &amp; today, she was almost herself yesterday but today she fought with me and an ostomy nurse for 2 hours about changing her ileostomy bag (it was failing) and she suddenly decided I could put it on then was happy.

I feel so shitty and my self esteem has never been lower. I don't even need chemo or radiation. My life isn't in serious danger.

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 16 year old boy as the title says, and I'm completing my treatment of 3 years in June of this year.\n\nI was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 13, 4 days right after my 13th birthday on the 14th of February, 2019. I was undiagnosed for 4 - 5 months with major symptoms (Severe lower back pain, which progressed as the days passed, frequent infection, decreasing appetite, fatigue, loss of movement in the 3rd month, the ability to control my pee or my bowel movement.).\n\nAs I was undergoing treatment while going through puberty, I can say that my body hasn't completed its growth yet. I was on chemo for 8 whole months, and they really seemed to have stunted my growth in general. I still have hope that I might grow once I get off my medication.\n\nI turned 16 this year, and at the same time, I'm going to finish my treatment as well. I want to know the after effects of my treatment as my life progresses. I've read quite a lot of things about life after chemotherapy, but I want some feedback from a real person.\n\nI've been through chemo drugs, steroids and anti bacterial medicines. Steroids have affected me the worst. I hate them and their affects.\n\nI've been affected academically, due to chemo brain. I keep forgetting things, and don't have the interest to study. Maybe that's subjective to my lifestyle, but it is what it is. I'm a totally different person, I'm happy with who I am, but I definitely miss the younger me, who hadn't suffered this illness.\n\nI'm also concerned about things such as cancer returning back (relapse or a different cancer type), psychological effects without medication, other complications, and minor things.\n\nI'm also looking for a group to speak to about everything. When I was in the hospital, admitted in the paediatric ward, I didn't find anyone who was of my age. I only saw new born babies and toddlers in my ward. Not a single teenager or adolescent. My heart shattered when I found that out. There were almost 40+ small children in that ward, and watching them suffer at such a young age made me grief a lot. \n\nThank you",

I was also told to give her some other drug (can't remember the name) for her restlessness/agitation.\n\nA few days before her death she lost consciousness and right after she died white foam protruded from her mouth. I'm a little bit worried that she was given too much painkiller and as a result lost consciousness and foamed at the mouth after she died. The nurses said the foam was normal but I think they were just trying to ease my mind? Also, me and my sister got into an argument in front of her which was very dumb and mum was clearly upset and angry. Could this have lead to her losing consciousness earlier?\n\nI can't stop thinking about it lately, how I might've lessened her time with us.
